## Analysis ideas

- Ingredient Supply Data: Tracking data on your ingredients (quantity on hand, cost, supplier, etc.) can help ensure you never run out of what you need to bake your stroopwafels. This can also help with budgeting and cost control.

- Employee Data: Information about your employees, such as hours worked, roles, and performance, can help with staffing decisions and performance management.

- Customer Feedback Data: Collecting and analyzing customer feedback can provide valuable insights into how your products are received and how you might improve.

- Marketing and Advertising Data: If you do any marketing or advertising, tracking this data can help you understand which efforts are most effective at driving sales.

- Sales Trends: In addition to individual sales data, you might want to analyze trends over time. For example, you could look at how sales vary by time of day, day of the week, or season of the year.

- Waste and Efficiency Data: Tracking data on waste (e.g., how many stroopwafels are thrown away without being sold, or how much raw material is wasted) can help you improve your efficiency and reduce costs.

- Website and Online Sales Data: If you sell stroopwafels online, data about your website traffic, online sales, and digital marketing efforts could be very useful.

- Competitor Data: While this can be harder to come by, any information you can gather about your competitors can also provide valuable insights for your business.

- See the sales per day, per employee, to see if certain employees sell more. Perhaps look at the waster per day per employee as well.

- See profitability per location. 

- See waste per location.
